## Functionalities of the application

Mainly, my projects are made so I can make my life easier. Tracking stats of important matches live can get hard, specially with all the emotion happening at the moment. So, I developed this from scratch as practice. Feel free to check it, use it and make changes to it.

## Todos

### Work up on the tie-break system.

There's still a flaw that doesn't keep the game running when the tie-break score is 6x6 (which IRL must have a 2 point difference).

### Styling

My main thought was to make the scoreboard as closest to the WPT one as possible. But I'm a lazy designer, so God knows if I'll even do it.

### Customizability

Not all matches have 2 sets of 6 games each, and not all tie-breaks end in 7. For the future, I plan on adding a way of changing this.

## Project Setup
